// Daily life: food and energy.
//
// The two meters are never stored per second. A member's record holds the values at one instant
// (`at`); everything after that is worked out from the clock and from how the time was spent:
//   away    – disconnected or no activity for ten minutes. Energy returns; hunger falls slowly.
//   online  – active in the world. Both meters run down slowly.
//   home    – standing in their own home. Hunger as online; energy comes back fast.
// A record is rewritten only when something happens (a meal, a shift, a level change, coming or
// going), so a thousand idle members cost a thousand comparisons a second and no disk writes.
// Coming home, leaving home and a shift closing are told to this module by the rooms and work
// modules at the moment they happen; only the slow drift across a level is found by looking.
//
// A member has needs from the first time they ask for them (the App does on arrival). Until then
// this module does nothing for them: no meters, no notifications, no change to what a shift pays.
//
// Nothing here blocks anything. Being hungry or exhausted loses the on-form bonus and slows the
// walk; it never closes chat, friends, games, work or travel.
