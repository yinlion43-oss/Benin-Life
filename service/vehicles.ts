// Vehicles: kekes, danfos and cars that members board, drive and ride together.
//
// The service owns all of it. A vehicle has an id, a place in one room instance, seats, and at
// most one thing in control: a member at the wheel, or the service on a paid route. Members send
// intents; the service decides who sits where, steps the vehicle on its own clock against road
// data it trusts (vehicleRoutes.ts), carries everyone seated with it, and takes a charter fare once.
//
// Kept in memory: where vehicles are, who is in them, invitations, offers, quotes, crossings.
// Saved: which vehicle a member has borrowed and where it was last parked, and every paid ride's
// receipt with what became of it. A restart empties the seats; it never loses or repeats a payment.
//
// Single-process service only. On a sharded service rooms live on other threads, so every
// operation here answers "unavailable" and nothing else about the world changes.
