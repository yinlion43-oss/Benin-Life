// Public game files: fetched once, checked against the build's manifest, kept on the device.
//
// The manifest (src/assets/public-assets.index.json, built by scripts/build-asset-manifest.mjs) names
// every file this build may keep, with its sizes and the SHA-256 of its unpacked content. A file is
// handed to the game only when it matches, whether it came from the network or from the device, and
// it is written to the device only after that. Copies are stored under their content hash, so a new
// build reads the files it shares with the old one, downloads the ones that changed, and an old copy
// is removed once its replacement is in. Where the budget or the device is short of space, a copy this
// page has not read may be removed first to make room, but only when that frees enough for the new
// file. A path the manifest does not name is fetched and never kept. Nothing else is stored here: no
// photo, no service response, no request and no address.
//
// No DOM globals are read in this file: the browser's are passed in (src/assets/publicAssets.ts), so
// the same code runs under Node in scripts/verify-assets.ts.
