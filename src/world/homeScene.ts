// A home drawn from its plan: every room's floor, walls, doorways and ceiling, the front door, and
// the furniture standing in the rooms. `src/shared/homes.ts` is the authority for the plan; this
// file only draws it and says where a character can walk. Plan metres: +x east, +z south, the main
// room's north-west corner at the origin, the front door's outward heading a scene `rotation.y`.
//
// The geometry is batched: each room has one floor and one skin of wall in its own colours, and
// everything else (outer shell, trim, glass, ceilings, light fittings) is one mesh each, so a villa
// of eight rooms costs about twenty draws before furniture. Walls are drawn as a skin on the
// inside of every room, so two rooms that share a wall each show their own colour on their side.
